# JavaScript Interview Questions

### 1. What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.

### 2. What is the DOM in the context of JavaScript?

> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to manipulate the content and structure of a web page dynamically.

### 3. Explain the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript.

> -  `var` is function-scoped
> -  `let` is block-scoped
> -  `const` is also block-scoped but its value cannot be re-assigned after declaration

### 4. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript?

> Closures allow functions to access variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. They help create private variables and methods.

### 5. What is the event loop in JavaScript?

> The event loop is a mechanism that allows asynchronous JavaScript code to execute in a non-blocking way. It continuously checks the message queue and executes tasks in a loop.

### 6. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

> == is equality operator that performs type coercion, while === is the strict equality operator that checks both value and type.

### 7. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.

> Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

### 8. How does this keyword work in JavaScript?

> The value of this depends on how a function is called. In the global scope, it refers to the global object. In a method, it refers to the object on which the method is called.

### 9. What is a callback function in JavaScript?

> callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which will be invoked later when a specific event occurs or a condition is met.

### 10. Explain the purpose of the bind method in JavaScript.

> The bind method is used to create a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a specific value, allowing you to explicitly specify the value of this for a function.

### 11. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

> null is an assignment value representing the absence of any object value, while undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized.

### 12. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?

> JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype object, and if a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype chain.

### 13. Explain the concept of debouncing in JavaScript.

> Debouncing is a technique used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. It involves delaying the execution of a function until after a certain period of inactivity.

### 14. What is the purpose of the apply and call methods in JavaScript?

> Both apply and call are used to invoke a function with a specified this value. The difference lies in how arguments are passed: apply takes an array of arguments, while call takes the arguments individually.

### 15. Explain the concept of event delegation in JavaScript.

> Event delegation involves assigning a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements. This way, you can handle events for all these elements in one place, improving performance.

### 16. What is the purpose of the Promise object in JavaScript?

> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

### 17. What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript regarding variable reassignment?

> let allows variable reassignment, while const does not. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be changed.

### 18. How does the async/await feature in JavaScript simplify working with asynchronous code?

> async/await is a syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code. It helps in writing asynchronous code that is easier to read and understand.

### 19. What is the purpose of the localStorage and sessionStorage objects in JavaScript?

> localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage objects that allow you to store key-value pairs locally in a user’s browser. The main difference is that data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed, while data in sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends.

### 20. How can you clone an object in JavaScript?

> To clone an object in JavaScript, you can use methods like `Object.assign()`, the spread operator (`...`), or `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.
>
> Here's an example using the spread operator:
>
> ```javascript
> const originalObject = {
>    key1: 'value1',
>    key2: 'value2',
> }
>
> const clonedObject = { ...originalObject }
> ```

### 21. Explain the concept of the same-origin policy in JavaScript.

> The same-origin policy is a security measure that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This policy helps prevent malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data.

### 22. What is the purpose of the map function in JavaScript?

> The map function is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element of an existing array, without mutating the original array.

### 23. What is a closure, and how is it used in JavaScript?

> A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. Closures allow a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

### 24. How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?

> JavaScript uses mechanisms such as callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations. These help manage the flow of asynchronous code and improve readability.

### 25. Explain the concept of the prototype chain in JavaScript.

> The prototype chain is a mechanism by which objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. If a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the object’s prototype, and so on, forming a chain.

### 26. What is the purpose of the splice method in JavaScript?

> The splice method is used to add or remove elements from an array. It can both add new elements at a specified index and remove elements from a specific index.

### 27. How does event bubbling differ from event capturing in JavaScript?

> Event bubbling and event capturing are two phases of event propagation in the DOM. In event bubbling, the innermost element’s event is handled first, and then the event bubbles up to the outer elements. Event capturing involves handling the event at the outermost element first and then capturing it as it goes down to the inner elements.

### 28. What is the purpose of the filter function in JavaScript?

> The filter function is used to create a new array containing only the elements that pass a provided test. It does not mutate the original array.

### 29. Explain the concept of the try…catch statement in JavaScript.

> The try…catch statement is used for handling exceptions (errors) in JavaScript. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the try block, and if an exception occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block.

### 30. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

> null is an assignment value representing the absence of any object value, while undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized.

### 31. What is the purpose of the setTimeout function in JavaScript?

> The setTimeout function is used to delay the execution of a function or code block by a specified amount of time (in milliseconds).

### 32. Explain the concept of the EventEmitter in Node.js.

> EventEmitter is a class in Node.js that facilitates communication between objects in a publish/subscribe pattern. It allows one object to notify a set of listeners when an event occurs.

### 33. What is the purpose of the Object.keys() method in JavaScript?

> Object.keys() is used to return an array containing the names of all the enumerable properties of an object.

### 34. How does the for…of loop differ from the for…in loop in JavaScript?

> The for…of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object (arrays, strings, etc.), while the for…in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

### 35. Explain the concept of the fetch API in JavaScript.

> The fetch API is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, allowing for more flexible and powerful handling of network requests.

### 36. What is the purpose of the reduce function in JavaScript?

> The reduce function is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a specified function to each element and accumulating the result.

### 37. How does the localStorage differ from sessionStorage in JavaScript?

> Both localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage objects, but localStorage persists even after the browser is closed, while sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends.

### 38. Explain the concept of currying in JavaScript.

> Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. It allows for partial application of functions.

### 39. What is the purpose of the Object.create() method in JavaScript

> Object.create() is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. It provides a way to implement inheritance in JavaScript.

> addEventListener is used to attach an event handler to an element. It takes the event type and the function to be executed when the event occurs.

### 44. Explain the concept of the WeakMap in JavaScript.

> WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys must be objects. Unlike a Map, a WeakMap allows for garbage collection of its keys, making it suitable for scenarios where references to keys should not prevent them from being collected.

### 45. What is the purpose of the Number object in JavaScript?

> The Number object is a wrapper object that allows you to work with numeric values. It provides methods for converting values to numbers and performing mathematical operations.

### 46. How does JavaScript handle variable hoisting?

> Variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, allowing them to be used before they are declared in the code.

### 47. What is the purpose of the Array.from() method in JavaScript?

> Array.from() is used to create a new array instance from an array-like or iterable object. It provides a way to convert objects that are not arrays into arrays.

### 48. Explain the concept of memoization in JavaScript.

> Memoization is a technique used to optimize function calls by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### 49. What is the purpose of the Object.freeze() method in JavaScript?

> Object.freeze() is used to freeze an object, making it immutable. Once an object is frozen, its properties cannot be added, modified, or removed.

### 50. How does the this keyword work in arrow functions in JavaScript?

> In arrow functions, the value of this is lexically scoped, meaning it is determined by the surrounding scope and does not change with the function’s execution context. Arrow functions do not have their own this context.

### 51. What is the purpose of the Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() method in JavaScript?

> Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() is used to get the descriptor for a property of an object. The descriptor contains information such as whether the property is writable, enumerable, and configurable.

### 52. Explain the concept of the Event Loop in the context of JavaScript concurrency.

> The Event Loop is a crucial part of JavaScript’s concurrency model. It continuously checks the call stack and message queue, ensuring that asynchronous operations are executed in a non-blocking manner.

### 53. How can you handle errors in asynchronous code in JavaScript?

> You can handle errors in asynchronous code using try…catch blocks or by attaching a .catch() handler to a promise.

### 54. What is the purpose of the Array.map() method, and how does it differ from Array.forEach()?

> Array.map() creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element, while Array.forEach() executes a provided function once for each array element but does not create a new array.

### 55. Explain the concept of the Symbol data type in JavaScript.

> Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 6. It is used to create unique identifiers for object properties and avoids naming conflicts.

### 56. What is the purpose of the Object.is() method in JavaScript?

### 58. What is the difference between window and document in the context of the browser environment?

> window represents the global browser window and contains properties like document. document represents the HTML document loaded in the window and provides methods to manipulate its content.

### 59. Explain the concept of the WeakSet in JavaScript.

> WeakSet is a collection of objects where the objects must be unique. Similar to WeakMap, it allows for garbage collection of its elements.

### 60. What is a closure, and how can it lead to memory leaks in JavaScript?

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. Memory leaks can occur if closures create references to variables that are no longer needed, preventing them from being garbage collected.

### 61. How does the Array.reduce() method work, and what is an accumulator function?

> Array.reduce() is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying an accumulator function to each element. The accumulator function takes four parameters: accumulator, current value, current index, and the array.

### 62. Explain the purpose of the async keyword in JavaScript function declarations.

> Promise.race() is used to race multiple promises against each other, returning the value (or error) of the first promise that resolves or rejects.

### 66. Explain the concept of function currying and how it is achieved in JavaScript.

> Function currying is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions with a single argument. This can be achieved by returning a series of functions, each taking one argument, from the original function.

### 67. What is the purpose of the encodeURIComponent() function in JavaScript?

> encodeURIComponent() is used to encode special characters in a URL, ensuring that they are properly represented in the encoded URL.

### 68. How does the Object.values() method work in JavaScript?

> Object.values() returns an array of the enumerable property values of an object, in the same order as provided by a for…in loop.

### 69. Explain the concept of the Proxy object in JavaScript.
